### Assignment 2: Basic Exception Handling
**Required Knowledge**: Basic Exception Handling, Try-Except Block
**Instructions**:
1. Modify the `Car` class to include a method named `print_car_info()` that prints the car's make and model.
2. Add exception handling in the `print_car_info()` method using a try-except block to handle potential errors (e.g., if the attributes are not set using AttributeError to handle exception).
3. Test the method by:
   
Creating a `car1` object with valid `make` and `model` attributes and calling `print_car_info()`.
   
Creating a `car2` object without setting the attributes (or by setting them to `None`) and calling `print_car_info()` to see how the exception is handled.
