### Assignment 4: Fuel Check and Basic Exception Handling
**Required Knowledge**: Class Methods, Basic Exception Handling
**Instructions**:
1. Extend the `Car` class by adding an attribute `fuel_level` that represents the carâ€™s current fuel level.
2. Add a method named `check_fuel` that raises a `ValueError` if `fuel_level` is less than 5.
3. Implement a method named `drive` that reduces the `fuel_level` by a certain amount and calls `check_fuel`.
4. Test this by driving the car and catching the `ValueError` if the fuel level gets too low.

        if self.fuel_level < 5:
            raise ValueError("Fuel level is too low!")
